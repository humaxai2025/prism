## Risk Assessment

{{#if (count_by_severity ambiguities "Critical")}}
🔴 **CRITICAL RISK** - {{count_by_severity ambiguities "Critical"}} critical {{pluralize (count_by_severity ambiguities "Critical") "issue" "issues"}} require immediate attention.
{{else if (count_by_severity ambiguities "High")}}
🟠 **HIGH RISK** - {{count_by_severity ambiguities "High"}} high-severity {{pluralize (count_by_severity ambiguities "High") "issue" "issues"}} should be addressed before implementation.
{{else if (gt (len ambiguities) 0)}}
🟡 **MODERATE RISK** - {{len ambiguities}} {{pluralize (len ambiguities) "issue" "issues"}} identified for improvement.
{{else}}
🟢 **LOW RISK** - Requirements quality is good with minimal issues.
{{/if}}

## Recommendations

{{#if (gt (count_by_severity ambiguities "Critical") 0)}}
### Immediate Actions Required

- Consider impact on project timeline
{{/if}}

### General Recommendations
- Run comprehensive testing on affected components
- Update traceability matrix with requirement changes  
- Monitor implementation for requirement drift
